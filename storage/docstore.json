Introduction \nThe continuous rise in temperature of the pla net is \nreally upsetting. The root cause for this is global \nwarming.  Global warming begins when sunlight \nreaches the Earth. The clouds, atmospheric particles, \nreflective ground surfaces and surface of oceans then \nsends back about 30 %  of sunlight back into the space, \nwhilst the remaining is absorbed by oceans, air and \nland. This consequently heats up the surface of the \nplanet and atmosphere, making life feasible. As the \nEarth warms up, this solar energy is radiated by thermal \nradiation and infrare d rays, propagating directly out to \nspace thereby cooling the Earth. However, some of the \noutgoing radiation is re -absorbed by carbon dioxide, \nwater vapours, ozone, methane and other gases in the \natmosphere and is radiated back to the surface of Earth. \nThese gases are commonly known as greenhouse gases \ndue to their heat-trapping capacity. It must be noted that \nthis re-absorption process is actually good as the Earth\u2019s \naverage surface temperature would be very cold if there \nwas no existence of greenhouse gas es. The dilemma \nbegan when the concentration of greenhouse gases in \nthe atmosphere was artificially increased by humankind \nat an alarming rate since the past two centuries. As of \n2004, over 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide was pumped \nthermal radiation is further hindered by increased levels \nof greenhouse gases resulting in a phenomenon known \nas human enhanced gl obal warming effect. Recent  \nobservations regarding global warming have \nsubstantiated the theory that  it is indeed a human \nenhanced greenhouse effect that is causing the planet to \nheat up. The planet has experienced the largest increase \nin surface temperature over the last 100 years. Between \n1906 and 2006, the Earth\u2019s average surface temperature \naugmented between 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius, h owever \nthe last 50 years saw the rate of temperature increase \nnearly doubling. Sea levels have shown a rise of about \n0.17 meters during the 20 th century. The extent of \nArctic sea ice has steadily reduced by 2.7 % per d ecade \nsince 1978 [1]. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nout per year. Millions  of pounds of methane gas are \ngenerated in landfills and agricultural decomposition of \nbiomass and animal manure. Nitrous oxide is released \ninto the atmosphere by  various nitrogen -based \nfertilizers including urea and diammonium phosphate  \nand other soil man agement utilizations. Once released, \nthese greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for \ndecades or even longer. According to \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \ncarbon dioxide and methane levels have increased by 35 \n% and 148 % since the industrial revolution of 1750.  \n \nII.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3090, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b51f329e-a00e-4939-8bb2-831ce6329000": {"__data__": {"id_": "b51f329e-a00e-4939-8bb2-831ce6329000", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b49a4ca4-01d1-4d86-adfe-bba31d874c8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "hash": "49ad85234c6ada3f93b40aa411bdfb7e1fad5df7acb9c3e85a3babc8b8bc2ba2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2adf867c-8aa4-44df-ae56-3706d9185347", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "hash": "e0d0232c3687b519d772c5988a752c96fa42ce81f1c620297599f042d4f5ddd9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "II. Greenhouse Effect \nWhile other planets in the  solar system of the Earth \nare either roasting hot or bitterly cold, Earth's surface \nhas relatively mild, steady temperatures. Earth enjoys \nthese temperatures because of its atmosphere, which is \nthe thin layer of gases that cover and protect the \nplanet. However, 97 % of climate scientists and \nresearchers agree that humans have changed the Earth's \natmosphere in dramatic ways over  the past two \ncenturies, resulting in  global warming. To understand \nglobal warming, it is first necessary to become familiar \nwith the greenhouse effect. As Fig.1 depicts, the natural \ngreenhouse effect normally traps some portion of heat \nin such a way that our planet is safe from reaching \nfreezing temperatures while human enhanced \ngreenhouse effect leads to global warming. This is due \nto burning of fossil fuels which increase the amount of \ngreenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and oxides \nof nitrogen) present in the atmosphere [2]. \n \nAbstract-Many researchers, engineers and environmentalists are expressing deep concerns about changes in the overall \nclimate of the planet. Fossil fuels are being continuously used to produce electricity. The burning of these fuels produces \ngases like carbon dioxi de, methane and nitrous oxides which lead to global warming. Deforestation is also leading to \nwarmer temperatures. The hazard of global warming is continuously causing major damage to the Earth's environment. \nMost people are still unaware of global warming and do not consider it to be a big problem in years to come. What most \npeople do not understand is that global war ming is currently happening,  and we are already experiencing some of its \nwithering effects. It is and will severely affect ecosystems and disturb ecological balance. Because of the treacherous \neffects of global warming, some solutions must be devised. The paper introduces global warming, elaborates its causes and \nhazards and presents some solutions to solve this hot issue.  Above all, alternative  energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, \ngeothermal, bio mass) need to be  seriously pursued. Finding and using renewab le sources of energy is one of the methods \nto combat the ever increasing global warming effectively. \n \nKeywords: Climate, fossil fuels, deforestation, global warming, alternative energy sources", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3087, "end_char_idx": 5438, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62b5e20c-5c55-4af5-88d0-46618b6793fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "62b5e20c-5c55-4af5-88d0-46618b6793fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1461b9ff-f6e3-4a94-8de3-0ebbb56c62b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "hash": "470333cbffa2887174a21d85a7a6547e398d1a0f454ef7f7ee480eebb5856190", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfe1f080-da07-4cff-993b-319f9e0c865f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad268ded612d505fd0fffc720be6139b02cae9dc7dad20f6671b3319e24b1116", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "D u r r e e s a m i n  J o u r n a l  ( I S S N :  2 2 0 4 - 9 8 2 7 )     \nA u g u s t  V o l  1  I s s u e  4 ,  Y e a r  2 0 1 5  \n \n \n \n \nFig.1 Types of greenhouse effects [2] \n \nThe trade of incoming and outgoing radiation that \nheats up the Earth is often referred to as the greenhouse \neffect because a greenhouse works in a similar way \n(Fig.2). Incoming ultraviolet radiation easily passes \nthrough the glass walls of a greenhouse and  is absorbed \nby the plants and hard surfaces inside. Weaker infrared \nradiation, however, has difficulty passing through the \nglass walls and is trapped inside, therefore, warming the \ngreenhouse. This effect lets tropical plants prosper \ninside a greenhouse, even during a cold season [2]. \n \n \n \nFig. 2 Plants embodied in a greenhouse [3] \n \nA similar phenomenon takes place in a car which is \nparked outside on a cold sunny day. Incoming solar \nradiation warms the interior of the car but outgoing \nthermal radiation is trapped inside the closed  windows \nof the cars. This entrapment basically warms up the car. \nThis trapping occurs in such a way that the hot air does \nnot rise and does not lose energy tho ugh convention \n[2].This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 3. \n \nFig. 3 Greenhouse effect example [4] \n \nIn the words of Michael Daley, an Associate \nProfessor of Environmental Science at Lasell College: \n\"Gas molecules that absorb thermal infrared radiation, \nand a re in significant enough quantity, can force the \nclimate system. These types of gas molecules are called \ngreenhouse gases\u201d. Carbon dioxide and other \ngreenhouse gases act like a mantle, absorbing infrared \nradiation and preventing it from escaping into the o uter \nspace. The net effect is the regular heating of the Earth's \natmosphere and surface.  \nThe greenhouse effect, combined with increasing \nlevels of greenhouse gases and the resulting global \nwarming, is expected to have philosophical \nimplications. If global  warming continues unrestrained \nand nothing effective is done to limit this evil , it  will \ncause significant climate change, a rise in sea levels, \nextreme weather events and other ruthless natural, \nenvironmental and social impacts [2]. \nIII. Greenhouse Gases: A Hazard \nThere are many greenhouse gases which are mainly \nemitted by human activity. The first and foremost in the \nlist is carbon dioxide. Excessive burning of fossil fuels \nlike coal and oil is the major factor for producing this \ngas. Moreover, deforesta tion i.e. removal of trees for \nacquiring lands also causes large amount of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere. Cement manufacture also \ncontributes carbon dioxide to atmosphere when calcium \ncarbonate is heated generating lime and carbon dioxide. \nThe second culprit gas is methane, commonly known as \nnatural gas.

Causes of Global warming \nThe major cause of global warming is  the \ngreenhouse gases. They include carbon dioxide, \nmethane, nitrous oxides and in some cases chlorine and \nbromine containing compounds. The build -up of these \ngases in the atmosphere  changes the radiative \nequilibrium in the atmosphere. The ir overall effect is to \nwarm the E arth\u2019s surface and the lower atmosp here \nbecause greenhouse gases absorb some of the o utgoing \nradiation of Earth and re -radiate it back towards the \nsurface. The net warming from 1850 to the end of the \n20th century w as equivalent to nearly 2 .5 W/m 2 with \ncarbon dioxide  contribution about  60 % to this figure, \nmethane about 25 per cent, with nitrous oxides  and \nhalocarbons providing the remainder.  In 1985, Joe \nFarman, of the British Antarctic Survey, published a n \narticle showing the decrease in  ozone levels over \nAntarctica during the early 1980s. The response was \nstriking: large scale international scientific programmes \nwere mounted to prove that CF Cs (used as aerosol \npropellants in industrial cleaning fluids and in \nrefrigeration tools) were the cause of the problem. Even \nmore important was abrupt international action to curb \nthe emissions of CFCs. The s econd major cause of \nglobal warming is the depletion of ozone layer. This \nhappens mainly due to the presence of chlorine -\ncontaining source gases. When ultraviolet light  is \npresent, these gases diss ociate releasing chlorine atoms \nwhich then catalyses ozone destruction. Aerosols \npresent in the atmosphere are also causing global \nwarming by changing the climate in two different ways. \nFirstly, they scatt er an d absorb solar and infrared \nradiation an d secondly, they may alter the \nmicrophysical and chemical properties of clouds and \nperhaps affect their lifetime and extent. The scattering \nof solar radiation acts to cool the planet, while \nabsorption of solar r adiation by aerosols warms the air \ndirectly instead of permitting sunlight to be absorbed by \nthe surface of the Earth. The human contribution to the \namount of aerosols in the atmosphere is of various \nforms. For instance, dust is a by-product of agriculture. \nBiomass burning generates a mixture of organic \ndroplets and soot particles. Many i ndustrial processes \nproduce a wide diversity of aerosols depending on what \nis being burned or generated in the manufacturing \nprocess. Moreover, exhaust emissions from various \nsorts of transport produce a rich mixture of pollutants \nthat are either aerosols from the outset or are \ntransformed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere to \nform aerosols [8].                                   \nV. Global Warming: The Effects \nPredicting the consequences of global warming is \none of the most difficult tasks faced by the climate \nresearchers.

When the weather turns warmer, evaporation \nprocess from both land and sea rises. This leads to \ndrought in the regio ns where increased evaporation \nprocess is not compensated by increased precipitation. \nIn some areas of the world, this will result in crop \nfailure and famine particularly in areas where the \ntemperatures are already high. The extra water vapour \ncontent in t he atmosphere will fall again as extra rain \nhence causing flood.

Effects on Living Beings \nGlobal warming can severely affect the health of \nliving beings. Excess heat can cause stress which may \nlead to blood pressure and heart diseases. Crop failures \nand famines, which are a direct consequence of heating \nup of earth, c an cause a decline in human body \nresistance to viruses and infections. Global warming \nmay also transf er various diseases to other reg ions as  \npeople will shift from reg ions of higher temperatures to \nregions of comparatively lower temperatures.  Warmer \noceans and other surfac e waters may lead to severe \ncholera outbreaks and harmful infections in some types \nof sea food [11]. \nMoreover, it is  an established fact that warmer  \ntemperatures lead to dehydration which is a major cause \nof kidney sto nes. A medical team from \nThe Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia examined the \nhealth proceedings  of more than 60,000 Americans \nalongside weather records. They discovered that \nindividuals were most likely to be  hospitalized with \nkidney stones three days after a temperature rise .

Perhaps the \nmost prominent mosquito -borne disease, West Nile \nVirus, has already experienced a sharp increase in \nannual cases. According to the U.S. Centres for Disease \nControl and Prevention , the summer of 2012 was the \nnastiest West Nile season on record,. The likely reason \nwas that summer's scorching heat and drought. Lyme \ndisease is another dangerous disease which is \ntransmitted mainly through bi tes from certain tick \nspecies [12]. \nFig. 8 describes in the form of a block diagram that \nhow alterations in global climate can affect human \nhealth.  The bitterest fact is that it can cause various \ndiseases and deprive human beings of the food. \n \nFig.8 Potential impacts of global climate change on \nhuman health [13] \nGlobal warming  is also affecting animals. They \nneed to move to cooler places in order to survive. This  \nprocess has been observed in various  places, for \ninstance, in the Alps, in mountainous Queensland in \nAustralia, and in the misty forests of Costa Rica. Fish in \nthe North Sea have been reported to move northwards \ntoo .The impacts on species are becoming no teworthy \nto such an extent that their movements can be used as a \nsign of a warming world. They are the silent witnesses \nof the swift changes being inflicted on the Earth. \nScientists and researchers predict that global warming is \ngradually damaging the ecosystems of various species \nand is playing a very unconstruc tive role in making \nthem extinct. For instance Asia\u2019s only ape \u2013 the orang-\nutan \u2013 is in bottomless trouble. Its last remaining \nstrongholds in the rainforests of Indonesia are being \nendangered by a r ange of pressures, including climate \nchange, putting the animal at the menace of extinction \nwithin a few decades. With global warming continually \nincreasing the duration and frequency of droughts, \nbushfires are occurring more often in these heavily \nlogged forests, further fragmenting the orang -utan\u2019s \nliving domain.  Similarly, in Africa,  elephants face a \nseries of threats including shrinking living space, which \nbrings them more regularly into divergence with people. \nWith this reduced living space, elephants will be unable \nto escape any changes to their natural habitat caused by \nglobal warming, including more common and longer \ndry periods, placing further pressure on their survival  \n[14].  \nVII. Alternative Energy Sources \nThe hazards caused by global warming are  \ntremendous. Excessive use of fossil fuels such as coal, \nnatural gas and oil play a part in it too. The usage of \nfossil fuels should be discontinued immediately. The  \nmost significant solution to put an end to this disaster is \nthe use of alternative energy sources.

These countries should extend their helpi ng \nhand to developing countries to combat the evil of \nglobal warming collectively. Using renewable ene rgy is \nthe most effective way to curtain the emission of g ases \nwhich play a major role in global warming. \nFig. 10 and Fig. 11 show that the use of renewables \nis gradually increasing. The figure should  be much \nmore than present so that we can tackle the problem of \nglobal warming timely and effectively. \n \nFig. 10 World fuel consumption in recent years [16] \n \n \nFig .11 Projected world energy mix in 2030 [17] \nVIII. Other Solutions  \nAs elaborated earlier, toxic emissions are a major \ncause of global warming, A likely solution to reduce \nharmful emissions is to cut the usage of vehicles which \nproduce them. This has not been met with much success \nas many people refuse to cut down their practice of \nusing cars. No doubt, some people have started to use \nbicycles and public transport, whereas some other \nprefer to walk but these numbers are relatively small.  It \nshould be noted that fuel economy and emission rates \nare chief factors to consider regarding the car choice. \nHybrid cars have high er efficiency and lower emission \nrates. Keeping the tires inflated will help improve \nmileage and air filters should be frequently replaced to \ncut down harmful emissions. People should share the \nride with frien ds or co -workers to reduce the total \nnumber of vehicles on the road. Print and social m edia \ncan play an effective role in curbing the problem. It \nshould use the philosophy of automobile advertisements \nto encourage drivers to conserve energy and reduce \npollution. Awareness campaigns can be  started using \nplacards, posters and logos similar to shown in Figures \n12-14. They are a very useful way to demonstrate that \nglobal warming is not good for the planet . Recycling is \nalso a good way to reduce global warming. People \nshould use rechargeable batteries instead of disposable \nones. Quality products should be bought that have a \nlong life. Shopping should be done from local markets \nwhich reduce  transportation.  Even small individual \nefforts like lowering the thermostats in winter and using \ncompact fluorescent lamps  instead of incandescent \nlamps can aid to address the issue of global warming. \nReforestation schemes must be started to grow a large \nnumber of trees. Forest degradation  and deforestation  \nmust be discouraged a t government level. Nuclear \npower is also a possible solution as this  power results in \nfewer emissions but this method should be used with \ncare as it can lead to severe accidents  therefore, the \nmajor hurdle is to overcome the security, propagation, \nwaste d isposal and high costs of nuclear power if this \nmethod has to be made practical [1]. \n \nFig. 12 shows symbolically how global warming is \ncausing the earth to melt [18] \n \n \nFig. 13 showing a symbolic representation to stop \nglobal warming [19]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3086, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0857259e-a313-4a68-9f3a-ab9e22e3e396": {"__data__": {"id_": "0857259e-a313-4a68-9f3a-ab9e22e3e396", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "711ce3b2-1d3e-4a57-bdb2-defbdec62499", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "global.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\fun\\qna_sys\\Data\\global.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 905607, "creation_date": "2024-12-28", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-27"}, "hash": "e74d1c58356579960632ebe82c491ee581815d6e9843728d01d98ffb44ef37b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "758ee96a-5834-4a96-9324-690b6f671cf1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1a228c123cb720710e6dafba7740ed90bad3dc687be2622ae3a17292808e2a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "D u r r e e s a m i n  J o u r n a l  ( I S S N :  2 2 0 4 - 9 8 2 7 )     \nA u g u s t  V o l  1  I s s u e  4 ,  Y e a r  2 0 1 5  \n \n \n \nFig. 14 depicting that how human beings are \ndestroying the earth for their own benefits [20] \n \nIX. Conclusion \nThe scientific and environmental community is on \nthe same page regarding the bitter reality of global \nwarming and the involvement of human factor in it.  \nThe paper discussed here has only  dented the surface of \nwhat is a very intricate line of scientific and engineering \nexploration. Global warming is a big hazard and \nappropriate measures must be taken to tackle this \nserious problem. This problem is not only causing \ntrouble to the human beings but also to animals and \nplants.  Melting of polar ice caps will lead to floods \nwhich can cause mayhem everywhere.  Rise of sea \nlevels will devastate agricultural and fishing activities.  \nTo embark upon these problems, some remedial steps \nmust be timely taken which include but are not  limited \nto the use of renewable sources of energy and stopping \ndeforestation. Innovative solutions must be brought \nforward to end this hazard once and forever. \n \nReferences \n[1] \u201cThe big melt -global warming\u201d,
